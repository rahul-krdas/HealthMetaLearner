# HealthMetaLearner

HealthMetaLearner is a toolkit for implementing hierarchical meta-learning-based recommender systems tailored for healthcare applications.

## Features

- **Hierarchical Meta-Learning:** Implement a flexible and customizable hierarchical meta-learning framework for healthcare recommender systems.
- **Multimodal Data Integration:** Support seamless integration of diverse healthcare data modalities, including electronic health records (EHRs), radiological imaging, genomic data, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and behavioral data.
- **Attention Mechanisms:** Integrate attention mechanisms for enhanced interpretability, allowing users to understand and trust the recommendation process.
- **Reinforcement Learning Integration:** Provide optional reinforcement learning modules for continuous improvement and adaptation based on real-world healthcare data and feedback.
- **Scalability and Flexibility:** Ensure the package's scalability and flexibility to accommodate various healthcare settings and data sources.
